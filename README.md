# Executive Barbering Shop Simulation (Java)

 Project Description
This is a Java console simulation of a barbering shop.  
It follows these rules:
- 1 main chair (Chair 0) + 5 waiting chairs (Chairs 1–5).
- VIP clients always take priority (pushing ORD clients to the right).
- ORD clients sit in the next available seat.
- If the shop is full, ORD clients are rejected.
- Press ENTER to trigger an event.
- Simulation runs for 20 steps.

 How It Works
- 0 → Barber finishes trimming current client.  
- 1 → A new VIP client arrives.  
- 2 → A new ORD client arrives.
